The transfer format will be JSON based.

In order to differentiate, null data will be string literals, NULL or null, with their respective keys.

Each Pokemon as a JSON unit will have the following keys as string literals:
"name" = NAME
"id" = POKEDEX_ID
"weight" = WEIGHT
"height" = HEIGHT
"location" = LOCATION
"summary" = SUMMARY
"type1" = TYPE1
"type2" = TYPE2
"exclusivity" = EXCLUSIVITY

In order to facilitate transfer between server and client, all communications will be a CSV of JSON units.
